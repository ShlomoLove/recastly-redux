# recastly-redux
The project is part of the recast.ly project I completed as a student at hackreactor. The project is a frontend YouTube replication application that refactored the React Library to incorporate Redux as well as the JQuery AJAX functionality to send API requests to YouTube. The project utilized pair programming.
